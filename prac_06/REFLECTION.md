# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Trying to start the lecture videos as early as possble. Taking extensive notes from lectures and spending a large amount
time testing programs. 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Commits are still an issue for me. I am not carrying them out as frequently as possible. I am also still having issue 
with my Pycharm console testing. The console testing works for my Git repository, but it doesn't work for my lecture 
videos repository. This might be related to my setup with Homebrew not sure. At this time I don't have time to 
trouble-shoot.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think I am using the pattens established in CP1401 well. I think writing everything out on my digital paper SuperNote 
device has really helped. As I can quickly search for any text even when handwritten.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I guess for me, I am still afraid to fail, so it is sometimes difficult to start a task because of the threat of failre.
I do know this is illogical as failure is just another way to learn. But I still struggle with this issue. I don't think
there is much more I can change at this point. The majority of my time is focused just on this subject. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I am spending all my time on this subject. It might just be my age, but I am still struggling to get through all the 
content. This might not be a issue for younger students, so it might just be me.
