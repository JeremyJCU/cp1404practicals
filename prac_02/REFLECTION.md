# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 3-6 hours. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

What lecture videos before practicals. Attempt to set up development software
correctly on macOS. Cover content as accurately as possible for practicals.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I have stopped all other activities. I only spent time studying for my MA1000 and
CP1404. I am learning as fast as possible, unfortunately the maths problems take
a lot of time. Also the CP1404 lecture videos, accompanying programming and software 
setup software bugs are difficult and time-consuming to resolve. I don't currently 
know how to correct some of the software setup issues I am experiencing with Homebrew
and Pycharm. I would like to troubleshoot, but I no longer have time.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Trying my best with all aspects. Weakness is imperative mood for function names, docstrings
and commit messages. I have had a checked history with Git and GitHub, so for me it is
vital I get Git and GitHub correct.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

At long last some of the prgramming patterns are becoming easier.
