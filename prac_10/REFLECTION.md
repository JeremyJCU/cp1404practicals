# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

0%. I was wrong for every estimate for every practical. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Even towards the end of the course it was still to short. I always needed to add hours, or a lot
more time for each activity.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

To learn something correctly takes a lot longer then expected.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

They make valid points and they point out obvious mistakes that I made. It is always
beneficial to have a fresh set of eyes on any code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

It is a good way of learning, as you have to make sure you understand
the failure well enough to make a comment about it.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.
